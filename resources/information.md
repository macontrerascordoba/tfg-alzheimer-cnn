## Description

- MPR:
  - This likely refers to the imaging sequence, and MPR stands for Multi-Planar Reconstruction, a technique used in MRI.

- MPR-R:
  - Similar to MPR, MPR-R could also refer to Multi-Planar Reconstruction, possibly indicating a different variant or version of the sequence.

- GradWarp:
  - GradWarp is a distortion correction technique used in MRI to correct for gradient-induced distortions in the images.

- B1 Correction:
  - B1 correction refers to a correction applied to account for variations in the radiofrequency (B1) field across the imaging volume.

- N3:
  - N3 typically refers to a bias field correction algorithm used to correct intensity variations in the MRI images.

- Scaled and Scaled_2:
  - These terms might refer to different scaling or normalization procedures applied to the images.

- No phantom for scaling:
  - This indicates that there was no phantom (a reference object used for calibration) involved in the scaling process.
